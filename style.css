/* style.css: deprecated
   Most layout and component styles have been migrated to Tailwind utility classes
   inside `index.html`. This file is intentionally kept minimal to avoid breaking
   references from the HTML while keeping visual rules centralized in Tailwind.

   If you want to fully remove this file, delete the <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   reference in `index.html` after confirming the UI in-browser.

/* No runtime rules required here — Tailwind utilities used throughout the app. */
